## fluent testing grounds

to get started:

you will need a local copy of [fluent-react](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js), so clone it, and locally cd into fluent.js/fluent-react, and `make` then `npm link`


then, when you are ready, come back here and

```sh
nvm use // node v8.9.1
npm i
npm link fluent-react
```
